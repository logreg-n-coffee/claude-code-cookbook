## Check Prompt

A comprehensive best practices collection for evaluating and improving prompt quality for AI agents. Systematizes insights gained from actual prompt improvement processes, covering all critical aspects including ambiguity elimination, information integration, enforcement strengthening, tracking systems, and continuous improvement.

### Usage

```bash
# Check prompt file quality
cat your-prompt.md
/check-prompt
"Check the quality of this prompt and provide improvement suggestions"
```

### Options

- None : Analyze current file or selected text
- `--category <name>` : Check only specific category (structure/execution/restrictions/quality/roles/improvement)
- `--score` : Calculate quality score only
- `--fix` : Auto-suggest fixes for detected issues
- `--deep` : Deep analysis mode (focus on ambiguity, information scatter, enforcement)

### Basic Examples

```bash
# Quality evaluation of entire prompt
cat devin/playbooks/code-review.md
/check-prompt
"Evaluate this prompt quality across 6 categories and provide issues and improvement suggestions"

# Deep analysis mode
/check-prompt --deep
"Focus on ambiguity, information scatter, and insufficient enforcement to provide fundamental improvement suggestions"

# Check specific category
/check-prompt --category structure
"Check this prompt from structure and clarity perspective"

# Detect and fix ambiguous expressions
/check-prompt --fix
"Detect ambiguous expressions and suggest clear expression fixes"
```

## Core Design Principles

### Principle 1: Completely Eliminate Room for Interpretation

- **Absolutely Prohibited**: "As a rule", "recommended", "if possible", "depending on situation", "judge appropriately"
- **Must Use**: "Must", "absolutely", "strictly adhere", "without exception", "mandatory"
- **Exception Conditions**: Strictly limited by numbers ("only the following 3 conditions", "except for these 2 cases")

### Principle 2: Strategic Information Integration

- Completely integrate related important information into one section
- Summarize the overall picture in execution checklists
- Thoroughly eliminate circular references and scatter

### Principle 3: Build Hierarchical Enforcement

- Clear hierarchy of üî¥ (execution halt level) ‚Üí üü° (quality important) ‚Üí üü¢ (recommended)
- Gradual promotion from recommended to mandatory level
- Clear indication of impact and countermeasures when violated

### Principle 4: Ensure Traceability

- Record and verify all execution results
- Technically prevent false reporting
- Objective success/failure judgment criteria

### Principle 5: Feedback-Driven Improvement

- Learn from actual failure cases
- Continuous effectiveness verification
- Automatic detection of new patterns

## üö® Critical Problem Patterns (Requires Immediate Fix)

### ‚ùå Level 1: Critical Ambiguity (Execution Stop Level)

- **Multiple interpretable instructions**: "Judge appropriately", "according to situation", "as a rule"
- **Ambiguous exception conditions**: "In special cases", "as needed"
- **Subjective judgment criteria**: "Appropriately", "sufficiently", "as much as possible"
- **Undefined important concepts**: "Standard", "general", "basic"

### ‚ùå Level 2: Structural Defects (Quality Important Level)

- **Information scatter**: Related important information scattered in 3+ locations
- **Circular references**: Infinite loops like Section A‚ÜíB‚ÜíC‚ÜíA
- **Contradictory instructions**: Conflicting instructions in different sections
- **Unclear execution order**: Procedures with unclear dependencies

### ‚ùå Level 3: Quality Degradation (Recommended Improvement Level)

- **Unverifiability**: Unclear success/failure judgment criteria
- **Automation difficulty**: Design dependent on human subjective judgment
- **Maintenance difficulty**: Structure where update impact scope is unpredictable
- **Learning difficulty**: Complexity that takes time for newcomers to understand

## üéØ Proven Improvement Methods

### ‚úÖ Gradual Strengthening Approach

1. **Current state analysis**: Problem classification, prioritization, impact assessment
2. **Critical problem priority**: Complete resolution of Level 1 problems as top priority
3. **Gradual implementation**: Execute in verifiable units rather than all changes at once
4. **Effect measurement**: Quantitative comparison before and after improvement
5. **Continuous monitoring**: Confirm sustainability of improvement effects

### ‚úÖ Practical Methods for Ambiguity Elimination

```markdown
# ‚ùå Before improvement (ambiguous)

"Issues should, as a rule, be described as inline comments on the relevant changed locations on GitHub"

# ‚úÖ After improvement (clear)

"Issues must be described as inline comments on the relevant changed locations on GitHub. Exceptions are only the 3 conditions defined in Section 3.3"
```

### ‚úÖ Practical Methods for Information Integration

```markdown
# ‚ùå Before improvement (scattered)

Section 2.1: "Use mandatory 6 sections"
Section 3.5: "üìä Overall evaluation, üìã Issues..."
Section 4.2: "Section deletion prohibited"

# ‚úÖ After improvement (integrated)

Execution Checklist:
‚ñ° 10. Post summary comment (use mandatory 6 sections)
üî¥ Mandatory 6 sections: 1) üìä Overall evaluation 2) üìã Issue classification summary 3) ‚ö†Ô∏è Major concerns 4) ‚úÖ Commendable points 5) üéØ Conclusion 6) ü§ñ AI review quality self-assessment
‚ùå Absolutely prohibited: Section deletion, addition, or renaming
```

### ‚úÖ Tracking System Implementation Patterns

```bash
# Strict tracking of execution results
POSTED_COMMENTS=0
FAILED_COMMENTS=0
TOTAL_COMMENTS=0

# Record results of each operation
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "‚úÖ Success: $OPERATION" >> /tmp/execution_log.txt
    POSTED_COMMENTS=$((POSTED_COMMENTS + 1))
else
    echo "‚ùå Failed: $OPERATION" >> /tmp/execution_log.txt
    FAILED_COMMENTS=$((FAILED_COMMENTS + 1))
fi

# Prevention of false reporting
if [ $POSTED_COMMENTS -ne $REPORTED_COMMENTS ]; then
    echo "üö® Warning: Reported count and actual posted count mismatch"
    exit 1
fi
```

## üìà Quality Score Calculation (Improved Version)

### Overall Score Calculation

```
Base Score = Œ£(Each Category Score √ó Points) / 100

Critical Problem Penalties:
- Level 1 problems: -20 points/case
- Level 2 problems: -10 points/case
- Level 3 problems: -5 points/case

Bonus Elements:
- Automation support: +5 points
- Learning function implementation: +5 points
- Proven improvement cases: +5 points

Final Score = Base Score + Bonus - Penalty
```

### Quality Level Assessment

```
95-100 points: World-class standard (Recommendable as industry standard)
90-94 points:  Excellent (Ready for production use)
80-89 points:  Good (Production ready with minor improvements)
70-79 points:  Average (Improvements needed)
60-69 points:  Needs improvement (Major modifications required)
50-59 points:  Major revision needed (Fundamental review required)
49 points or below: Prohibited for use (Complete redesign required)
```

2. **Data-driven**: Base improvements on actual measurement data, not subjective judgment
3. **Continuous monitoring**: Regularly verify the sustainability of improvement effects
4. **Feedback emphasis**: Actively collect opinions from actual users

#### Failure Avoidance Strategies

1. **Excessive perfectionism**: Start operations at 90 points, aim for 100 points through continuous improvement
2. **Risks of bulk changes**: Always implement large-scale changes in phases
3. **Backward compatibility**: Minimize impact on existing workflows
4. **Documentation deficiency**: Record and share all changes in detail

### Integration with Claude

```bash
# Quality check combined with prompt files
cat your-prompt.md
/check-prompt
"Evaluate the quality of this prompt and propose improvements"

# Comparison of multiple prompt files
cat prompt-v1.md && echo "---" && cat prompt-v2.md
/check-prompt
"Compare the two versions and analyze improved points and remaining issues"

# Analysis combined with actual error logs
cat execution-errors.log
/check-prompt --deep
"Identify prompt issues that may have caused these errors"
```

### Important Notes

- **Prerequisites**: Prompt files should preferably be written in Markdown format
- **Limitations**: For large prompts (over 10,000 lines), it's recommended to divide and analyze them
- **Recommendations**: Regularly conduct prompt quality checks and continuously improve
