## Show Plan

Display plans that are currently running or have been executed in the current session.

### Usage

```bash
/show-plan
```

### Basic Examples

```bash
# Check current plan
/show-plan
"Display running plan"

# When no plan exists
/show-plan
"No plan exists in current session"
```

### Features

- Detect plans created with exit_plan_mode
- Search for headings containing keywords like implementation plan, implementation content, plan
- Format and display plan content
- Clearly notify when no plan exists

### Integration with Claude

```bash
# Check plan during implementation
"What was I implementing?"
/show-plan

# When executing multiple tasks
"Let me check the current plan again"
/show-plan

# Review after plan execution
"Show me the content of the plan I just executed"
/show-plan
```

### Detection Patterns

Based on plan formats generated by exit_plan_mode, detect the following patterns:

- Headings starting with `##` (containing plan, implementation, project)
- `### Change Content`
- `### Implementation Content`
- `### Implementation Plan`
- Numbered headings like `### 1.`

### Important Notes

- Display only plans within current session (past sessions not included)
- Prioritize displaying latest plan
