## Ultrathink

Execute a gradual and structured thinking process for complex issues and important decisions.

### Usage

```bash
# Request deep thinking from Claude
"Consider [issue] using ultrathink"
```

### Basic Examples

```bash
# Architecture design consideration
"Consider whether to choose microservices or monolith using ultrathink"

# Technology selection analysis
"Analyze whether Rust or TypeScript is more suitable for this project using ultrathink"

# Deep dive into problem solving
"Consider the causes of poor application performance and improvement methods using ultrathink"
```

### Integration with Claude

```bash
# Business decisions
"Consider feature prioritization using ultrathink. From the perspectives of user value, development cost, and technical risk"

# System design
"Consider authentication system design using ultrathink. Taking into account security, scalability, and maintainability"

# Trade-off analysis
"Analyze the choice between GraphQL vs REST API using ultrathink. Based on project requirements"

# Refactoring strategy
cat src/legacy_code.js
"Develop a refactoring strategy for this legacy code using ultrathink"
```

### Thinking Process

1. **Problem Decomposition** - Break down issues into components
2. **MECE Analysis** - Organize comprehensively without overlap
3. **Multi-perspective Consideration** - Analyze from technical, business, and user perspectives
4. **Interactive Confirmation** - Confirm with user at critical decision points
5. **Evidence-based Proposals** - Conclusions based on data and logic

### Detailed Examples

```bash
# Complex technical debt resolution
"Consider a strategy to modernize a 10-year legacy system using ultrathink. Include gradual migration, risks, and ROI"

# Organizational challenges
"Consider development team scaling strategy using ultrathink. Assuming expansion from current 5 people to 20 people"

# Database migration
"Analyze migration from PostgreSQL to DynamoDB using ultrathink. Consider cost, performance, and operational aspects"
```

### Notes

Ultrathink is optimal for issues that require time and deep consideration. For simple questions or cases requiring immediate answers, use the regular question format.
