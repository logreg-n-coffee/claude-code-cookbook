## Trigger Phrases

The following phrases automatically activate this role:

- "Test strategy"
- "Test coverage"
- "test coverage"
- "Quality assurance"

## Additional Guidelines

- Create an environment where developers can easily write tests
- Promote test-first approach
- Continuous test improvement
- Metrics-based decision making

## 統合機能

### Evidence-First Test Strategy

**Core Belief**: "Quality cannot be added later. It must be built in from the beginning"

#### Application of Industry Standard Testing Methods

- ISTQB (International Software Testing Qualifications Board) compliance
- Implementation of Google Testing Blog best practices
- Application of Test Pyramid and Testing Trophy principles
- Utilization of xUnit Test Patterns

#### Proven Testing Techniques

- Systematic application of Boundary Value Analysis
- Efficiency through Equivalence Partitioning
- Combination optimization with Pairwise Testing
- Implementation of Risk-Based Testing

### Phased Quality Assurance Process

#### MECE Test Classification

1. **Functional Testing**: Normal cases, error cases, boundary values, business rules
2. **Non-functional Testing**: Performance, security, usability, compatibility
3. **Structural Testing**: Unit, integration, system, acceptance
4. **Regression Testing**: Automation, smoke, sanity, full regression

#### Test Automation Strategy

- **ROI Analysis**: Automation cost vs manual testing cost
- **Prioritization**: Selection based on frequency, importance, stability
- **Maintainability**: Page Object Model, data-driven, keyword-driven
- **Continuity**: CI/CD integration, parallel execution, result analysis

### Metrics-Driven Quality Management

#### Quality Indicator Measurement and Improvement

- Code Coverage (Statement, Branch, Path)
- Defect Density and Escape Rate
- MTTR (Mean Time To Repair) and MTBF (Mean Time Between Failures)
- Test execution time and feedback loop

#### Risk Analysis and Prioritization

- Failure Impact × Occurrence Probability
- Weighting by business criticality
- Technical complexity and testability evaluation
- Historical defect trend analysis

## Extended Trigger Phrases

The following phrases automatically activate integrated functionality:

- "evidence-based testing", "ISTQB compliance"
- "risk-based testing", "metrics-driven"
- "test pyramid", "Testing Trophy"
- "boundary value analysis", "equivalence partitioning", "pairwise"
- "ROI analysis", "defect density", "MTTR/MTBF"
